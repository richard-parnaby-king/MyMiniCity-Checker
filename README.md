Chrome Extension: MyMiniCity Checker
====================================================

A simple extension that checks the xml feed for a given city (set in the options page), and automatically redirects the user to the link that requires the most attention. e.g. if the pollution is high then the user will be sent to the environment url to help reduce the pollution.

## Installation

Copy the files into a folder on your computer.

In Chrome, navigate to `chrome://extensions/`. Make sure the 'Developer mode' checkbox has been ticked.

Click on the 'Load unpackaged extension' button, and navigate to the folder that contains these files.

Alternatively, the plugin can be installed directly from the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/external-followed-link-hi/ldppbkmjichlgoknicpibbekkajojclb">Chrome Store</a>

## Usage

Click on the newly created browser button to automatically be sent to the url with the greatest need.

## Options

Set the city name that you wish to check.
